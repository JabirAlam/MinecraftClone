# MineCraftClone  

An **open-source Minecraft clone** built from scratch with the goal of learning, experimenting, and providing a free alternative to the original concept.  

This project is currently a **Work In Progress**, which means new features, bug fixes, and improvements are being added regularly. Expect breaking changes as the project evolves.  

## âœ¨ Goals
- Recreate the core Minecraft experience (world generation, blocks, crafting, survival, etc.)
- Keep the code open, simple, and easy to understand for anyone interested in game development
- Support modding and custom features in the future
- Provide cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
